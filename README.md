# Netflix Portfolio Project
## By Jediah Kai Shinjo Mattison



# Introduction 
Netflix is a streaming service that is used all over the world by millions of people. It started off as a simple DVD and game rental platform and now has evolved into the entertainment behemoth it is today. With a variety of shows and movies as well as Netflix original content it has completely revolutionized how we consume media entertainment. 



# Project Focus
The goal of this project was to see what kind of content Netflix has. This consists of how many movies and shows there are and what categories they fall into. The categories are TV and movie ratings and their respective genres. I also wanted to know how Netflix's content has increased over time. Lastly I wanted to see if Netflix has content from the top ten most famous hollywood directors based on IMDB's top ten list. 

# Getting Started 
I started by using the [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). This dataset contains columns such as title, genre, rating, date added to netflix, date released, director, cast, country and a short description of the show. I first used the pgadmin tool to create a table in my local instance of SQL. I then created the columns and imported the csv file containing the data.
